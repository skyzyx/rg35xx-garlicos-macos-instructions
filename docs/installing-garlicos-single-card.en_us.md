# Installing Garlic OS on your Anbernic RG35XX using macOS (single-card setup)

Instructions for installing Garlic OS on your Anbernic RG35XX using macOS. Adapted and expanded from <https://pastebin.com/YV1Va5JL>, originally written by _A GUEST_ on 2022-12-30. (I wish there were a better way to cite your work â€” Iâ€™m sorry!)

Each step is explained in English with the corresponding terminal command below it. These instructions should work without problem on any modern macOS â€” with either Intel or Apple Silicon CPUs. Tested on macOS Ventura 13.5 on both an Intel i9 chip, and an Apple M1 Max chip.

> [!CAUTION]
> You will end up formatting the `ROMS` partition completely, so it is best to do this before you waste time copying any rom files over.

## Prerequisites

* A _relatively_ [recent version of macOS](https://gist.github.com/skyzyx/225b59847be31b39d3d19c3a1c006862).

    <div><img src="images/finder@2x.png" alt="Finder icon" width="55"></div>

* Download [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher). The free version is totally fine.

    <div><img src="images/balena-etcher@2x.png" alt="balenaEtcher icon" width="55"></div>

* Comfortable-enough using _Terminal.app_ (or alternatives).

    <div><img src="images/terminal@2x.png" alt="Terminal icon" width="55"></div>

* An application which can open `.7z` archives. I can recommend:

    * [The Unarchiver](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353?mt=12) (free)
    * [Archiver](https://archiverapp.com) (paid)

* You have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed. ([Installation](https://mac.install.guide/homebrew/index.html) is outside the scope of this tutorial, but itâ€™s pretty fundamental if you do technical things on your Mac.)

    * This includes installing the [Xcode CLI tools](https://mac.install.guide/homebrew/2.html) (a much smaller download than the _entire_ Xcode).

## Downloading Garlic OS

1. Visit <https://www.patreon.com/posts/76561333>

1. Read through the release notes so that you understand what youâ€™re installing.

1. Just above the comment section are the download links. Download both parts.

    * `RG35XX-MicroSDCardImage.7z.001`
    * `RG35XX-MicroSDCardImage.7z.002`

1. Decompress the `.7z` files.

    1. macOS can open `.7z` files natively.

    1. Select _both_ files.

    1. _Right-click_ with a mouse; _two-finger tap_ on a trackpad; or _control-click_ with the keyboard â€” and then choose _Open_ from the menu.

        (Or if you prefer the keyboard, type _command-down_ (`âŒ˜ â†“`) to open files.)

        ![Screenshot of opening the file with the context menu](images/downloads-folder@2x.png)

1. This will result in a new directory called `RG35XX-MicroSDCardImage.7z/` with `garlic.img` inside.

## Flashing the microSD card

> [!CAUTION]
> If you have data you care about on the microSD card, back it up before flashing it with Garlic OS.

1. Launch _balenaEtcher_.

    ![Screenshot of default screen](images/balena-default@2x.png)

1. Choose _Flash from file_, then find and select the `garlic.img` disk image we downloaded previously.

1. Under _Select target_, choose the device which contains your microSD card. (Take note of the device ID under the _Location_ header.)

    ![Screenshot of microSD selection](images/balena-card@2x.png)

1. Choose the _Flash!_ button.

    ![Screenshot of the Flash! button](images/balena-flash@2x.png)

1. Let the flashing process run until it completes.

    ![Screenshot of the flashing process](images/balena-flashing@2x.png)

1. Your microSD card volumes will be _unmounted_ after the flashing. Pop your card out, then put it back in so that Finder mounts your new volumes on the desktop.

    If you donâ€™t see the drives on the desktop, check your _Finder settings_ (or _Finder preferences_ in older macOS releases).

    1. Go to Finder (click on the background, click inside a Finder window, etc.).
    1. In the upper-left, find the _Finder_ menu, and choose _Settingsâ€¦_ (or _Preferencesâ€¦_ in older macOS releases).
    1. Check to see that _CDs, DVDs, and iPods_ is checked.

        <div><img src="images/finder-settings@2x.png" alt="Screenshot of Finder settings" width="427"></div>

1. If the flashing process named both partitions _No Name_, then rename the larger partition (â‰ˆ3.38 GB) as _ROMS_ and the smaller partition (â‰ˆ10.4 MB) as _MISC_. This can be done in Finder the same way as renaming any other file.

    <div><img src="images/partitions@2x.png" alt="Screenshot of renamed partitions" width="287"></div>

1. Back up the `BIOS/` and `CFW/` folders from the _ROMS_ partition. You will need to restore them after the partition resizing.

## Running gdisk

1. Install `gdisk` using Homebrew.

    ```bash
    brew install --cask gdisk
    ```

1. Use `diskutil` (installed by default on macOS) to view the list of mounted drives and look for the microSD card path. I have _several_ external hard drives, and mine was `/dev/disk11` with 4 partitions.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you paid attention to the _Location_ column in _balenaEtcher_ when you were selecting a disk target, this will be the _same location_.

    ```bash
    diskutil list
    ```

    ```plain
    /dev/disk11 (internal, physical):
    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *31.9 GB    disk11
    1:       Microsoft Basic Data MISC                    10.5 MB    disk11s1
    2:       Microsoft Basic Data                         536.9 MB   disk11s2
    3:       Microsoft Basic Data                         53.5 MB    disk11s3
    4:       Microsoft Basic Data ROMS                    3.4 GB     disk11s4
    ```

1. Launch `gdisk` using `sudo`. You will likely need to enter your password to authenticate.

    > [!NOTE]
    > `sudo` grants administrative permissions to your user, as if to say "super user, do this." If you donâ€™t use `sudo` it will launch, but it will fail on some of the later steps.

    ```bash
    sudo gdisk
    ```

1. `gdisk` will ask for your device ID. Weâ€™ve already found this twice. ðŸ˜‰

    ```plain
    GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.9

    Type device filename, or press <Enter> to exit:
    ```

    My value was `/dev/disk11`. Yours may be different.

    ```plain
    Warning: Devices opened with shared lock will not have their
    partition table automatically reloaded!
    Partition table scan:
    MBR: protective
    BSD: not present
    APM: not present
    GPT: present

    Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.

    Command (? for help):
    ```

1. Enter the _print_ command to verify we have loaded the right disk.

    ```plain
    p
    ```

    ```plain
    Disk /dev/disk11: 62333952 sectors, 29.7 GiB
    Sector size (logical): 512 bytes
    Disk identifier (GUID): 8F10075C-0512-4DBA-944E-1ADF2C17F4C0
    Partition table holds up to 128 entries
    Main partition table begins at sector 2 and ends at sector 33
    First usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 7812466
    Partitions will be aligned on 2048-sector boundaries
    Total free space is 16350 sectors (8.0 MiB)

    Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
    1           16384           36863   10.0 MiB    0700  MISC
    2           36864         1085439   512.0 MiB   0700  SYSTEM
    3         1085440         1189887   51.0 MiB    0700  CONFIG
    4         1189888         7812466   3.2 GiB     0700  ROMS

    Command (? for help):
    ```

    Your values may be different. The important bits are these 4 partitions, with these approximate sizes.

1. We need a command that is only available in _expert mode_.

    ```plain
    x
    ```

    ```plain
    Expert command (? for help):
    ```

1. Move backup data structures to end of disk.

    ```plain
    e
    ```

    ```plain
    Relocating backup data structures to the end of the disk

    Expert command (? for help):
    ```

1. Exit _expert mode_ and return to main menu.

    ```plain
    m
    ```

    ```plain
    Command (? for help):
    ```

1. Delete the `ROMS` partition from the GPT table by entering _delete mode_.

    ```plain
    d
    ```

    ```plain
    Partition number (1-4):
    ```

1. For me the `ROMS` partition was 4. Verify yours from the initial print command, but it should also be 4.

    ```plain
    4
    ```

    ```plain
    Command (? for help):
    ```

1. Enter print command again to verify that we have deleted the correct partition.

    > [!NOTE]

    Command (? for help):
    ```

1. Enter _create new partition mode_.

    ```plain
    n
    ```

    ```plain
    Partition number (4-128, default 4):
    ```

1. Choose `4`.

    ```plain
    4
    ```

    ```plain
    First sector (34-62333918, default = 1189888) or {+-}size{KMGTP}:
    ```

1. When it asks you the for first and last sector, press `enter` on both of these to use the default values.

    ```plain
    enter
    ```

    ```plain
    Last sector (1189888-62333918, default = 62332927) or {+-}size{KMGTP}:
    ```

    ```plain
    enter
    ```

    ```plain
    Current type is AF00 (Apple HFS/HFS+)
    Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = AF00):
    ```

1. For the hex code, choose `0700` for _Microsoft Basic Data_ (as the partition is FAT32).

    ```plain
    0700
    ```

    ```plain
    Changed type of partition to 'Microsoft basic data'

    Command (? for help):
    ```

1. Enter print command again to verify that we have deleted the correct partition.

    You should reboot or remove the drive.
    The operation has completed successfully.
    ```

1. Eject the mounted volumes. You can either:

    1. Select them and drag them to the trash can, orâ€¦

    1. _Right-click_ with a mouse; _two-finger tap_ on a trackpad; or _control-click_ with the keyboard â€” and then choose _Eject_ from the menu.

1. Pop your card out, then put it back in so that Finder mounts your new volumes on the desktop.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The size of the `ROMS` volume will still be incorrect until the next step.

## Cleaning up and restoring backups

1. Open _Disk Utility_ (installed by default on macOS), and find the ROMS partition.

    ![Screenshot of Disk Utility](images/diskutil-default@2x.png)

1. Erase the partition. For the name, keep `ROMS`. For the format, choose _MS-DOS (FAT)_.

    ![Screenshot of Disk Utilityâ€™s erase dialog](images/diskutil-erase@2x.png)

1. Wait for it to complete.

    ![Screenshot of Disk Utilityâ€™s completion dialog](images/diskutil-complete@2x.png)

1. Finally re-copy the `BIOS/` and `CFW/` folders we backed-up earlier, and any ROM files and/or save files that you want to make available to your device.
